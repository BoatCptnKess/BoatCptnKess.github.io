        <summary><em>Community college sued after banning flyers critical of socialism: Aug 25, 2022</em></summary>
        <p>Administrators removed student group’s posters condemning socialism and ‘progressive ideas’

<p>Three students sued their California community college for its ban on flyers expressing political views and another restrictive student expression policy.

<p>Alejandro Flores, Daniel Flores and Juliette Colunga, founding members of Young Americans for Freedom at Clovis Community College in California, sued administrators to stop a ban on content considered “inappropriate or offensive,” according to the federal complaint.

<p>“Administrators of public colleges cannot ban a student group’s flyers because some found the message inappropriate or offensive,” according to the August 11 complaint, which was filed with the representation of the Foundation for Individual Rights in Expression. Defendants include three administrators at Clovis, including President Lori Bennett.

<p>The College Fix reached out to Clovis Community College on August 15 and received a response from Stephanie Babb, director of marketing and communications. Babb declined to answer questions, and noted that “the district does not comment on pending litigation.”

<p>The YAF chapter posted flyers critical of socialism and progressivism in November 2021 for the organization’s “Freedom Week,” which aimed to condemn socialism and spread the message that “progressive ideas have led to the oppression and deaths of hundreds of millions around the globe,” according to the event’s website.

<p>The three students plaintiffs (pictured) “received permission from administrators to hang three flyers on bulletin boards inside Clovis’ academic buildings,” which the administration later ordered taken down, according to a news release from FIRE.

<p>Clovis administrator Leslie King wrote in November that she had “talked to several people that are very uncomfortable with it, and one person said they would file a harassment claim if these posters don’t come down,” according to an email obtained by FIRE.

<p>“I just want to confirm that we will be taking down the posters we discussed today, President Lori Bennett wrote in a later email to Dean of Student Services Gurdeep Herbert. “If you need a reason, you can let them know that Marco [De La Garza, vice president of student services] and I agreed they aren’t club announcements” and said that “we can discuss the updated list of rules next week.”

<p>Clovis’ “Poster/Flyer Instructions” at the time of the incident did not specify that student club posting was limited to announcements, according to a document shared by FIRE.

<p>“The [Clovis YAF] chapter has tried to put up posters before, and been successful. Prior to the Freedom Week posters, none of them were ever taken down,” Colunga, the president of the club, told The Fix in an August 16 email.

<p>Colunga’s hope for the lawsuit is that ”that the school introduces and implements a policy that explicitly protects and provides for free speech and the right for students to share their opinions freely on campus, regardless of what those opinions may be,” according to her email.

<p>”We often hear about students at well-known institutions standing up for their rights, but it’s vital that students on smaller campuses and junior colleges like ours stand up for what’s right, ” Colunga stated.

<p>“If I had to put a word to the student response on campus I would mostly say that the students are apathetic to getting coddled and spoon-fed opinion,” Flores, the vice president, wrote in a separate email to The Fix.

<p>Campus buildings should be open for free speech, FIRE tells The Fix

<p>The Fix also spoke with Jeff Zeman, one of the attorneys from FIRE listed in the lawsuit, about the grounds for the complaint and what he hopes will happen.

<p>Zeman told The College Fix that 1981 Supreme Court case Widmar v. Vincent should be seen as a legal precedent for this case. The Supreme Court ruled in that case that “having opened up its buildings for students’ expressive use, a public university could not keep some groups out based on the content of those groups’ speech.”

<p>“These cases can take a while” and “every case is different,” Zeman stated in response to The Fix’s questions regarding how he believed the lawsuit would be settled.

<p>“FIRE sees [censorship] across the country, and across the ideological spectrum – censorship coming from both the right and the left,” Zeman wrote. <a href="https://www.thecollegefix.com/community-college-sued-after-banning-flyers-critical-of-socialism/">Link to site</a></p>

        <summary><em>Community college limits ‘free’ degree program for union members after federal scrutiny: Aug 15, 2022</em></summary>
        <p>Department of Education questioned financial set-up of program

<p>Eastern Gateway Community College in Ohio will no longer enroll new students in its “Free College Benefit Program” while it works through legal issues with the U.S. Department of Education.

<p>Federal officials questioned the set-up of the benefit program marketed to union members. The Department of Education alleged in a letter that Pell grants for poorer students helped underwrite tuition for other enrollees who made too much money to qualify for that financial aid.

<p>“The college is still offering the Free College Benefit, but is not enrolling any new students into the program at this time,” according to an August update from the college.

<p>The community college had partnered with the for-profit Student Resource Center and the Union Free College Benefit (Union Plus), which recruit members of participating unions and get a cut of the federal fund disbursed to them, according to Inside Higher Ed.

<p>“EGCC is merely waiving/writing off all non-Pell/state grant charges on student accounts, and falsely making it appear that the students are being funded by outside entities,” according to the letter. “Essentially, under this program, students who receive Pell funding are being charged for the program, but students not receiving Pell are not.”

<p>“EGCC must not disburse Pell funds to any new students enrolling in the Free College Benefit Program until it is redesigned to charge full tuition and fees to all non-Pell eligible students,” the letter continued. “To accomplish this, EGCC must cease waiving the tuition and fees for non-Pell students.”

<p>The Education Department argued this violated the Title IV statute of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as it would result in Pell grant students being charged for tuition, fees and books while not charging non-Pell grant students.

<p>“Title IV recipients enrolled under the Free College Benefit Program are charged more than non-Title IV recipients enrolled under the same program. Consequently, this model violates the Title IV statute, and therefore, it cannot be used by EGCC as currently implemented,” the department noted.

<p>”The U.S. Department of Education’s goal is to minimize disruption to students as we assess the impact of Eastern Gateway Community College’s (EGCC’s) treatment of students from low-income backgrounds who are eligible for Federal Pell Grants,” DOE spokesman Alberto Betancourt wrote in a July 28 email.

<p>“EGCC is not permitted to disburse Federal Pell Grant funds to any new students accepted for enrollment in the Free College Benefit Program after July 18, 2022, until it is redesigned to comply with federal student aid laws and regulations.”

<p>College still offers benefit but not enrolling new students as of July 18

<p>The College Fix reached out to Eastern Gateway Community College and received a response from Cristen Tarquinio, associate vice president of marketing, on July 26. Tarquinio deferred to a July 27 press release.

<p>“Eastern Gateway Community College is excited to announce that EGCC can continue to offer the Free College Benefit for new and existing students for the Fall 2022 semester,” the release stated.

<p>“After thorough discussion with college legal counsel and the Ohio Attorney General’s Office, the college has concluded that it is in the best interest of EGCC to move forward only by exercising an abundance of caution,” the release continued. “As such, and until EGCC receives the responses from [the U.S. Department of Education], the college is temporarily suspending new enrollments in the Free College Benefit for Fall 2022.”

<p>The Fix reached out to one of the unions that utilizes the program, the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees, via its website on July 25, but has not received a response.

<p>The Fix also reached out on Aug. 10 to Joe Widener, a media representative at AFSCME Ohio Council 8, to ask what his members’ experience has been with the program and whether he knew about the allegations. It has not received a response.

<p>Accreditor put community college on probation last year

<p>The college’s programs have been under scrutiny since at least 2021.

<p>The Fix reached out to Laura Janota, a representative from the Higher Learning Commission, Eastern Gateway Community College’s accreditor, who noted on July 26 via email that the agency was monitoring the investigation by the U.S. Department of Education. An earlier letter, effective November 4, 2021, highlighted several problems at the community college.

<p>“The Higher Learning Commission is aware of the U.S. Department of Education investigation and is monitoring the situation carefully,” Janota stated.

<p>The college’s status had been changed from “Accredited” to “Accredited – On Probation,” according to the letter from the Higher Learning Commission. HLC determined that the higher education institution “does not meet [its] Criteria for Accreditation related to teaching and learning: quality, resources and support; and teaching and learning: evaluation and improvement.”

<p>“An institution’s accreditation may be withdrawn if it does not meet one or more of the Criteria for Accreditation, Federal Compliance requirements, Assumed Practices, Eligibility Requirements or Obligations of Membership,” Janota wrote.

<p>“Withdrawal is only one possible outcome of the Probation process,” the HLC spokeswoman wrote in a subsequent email. “HLC could decide to lift Probation if concerns have been remedied or any number of other actions could be taken by HLC to help/support/encourage the institution to remedy our concerns.” <a href="https://www.thecollegefix.com/ohio-community-college-limits-free-degree-program-for-union-members-after-federal-scrutiny/">Link to site</a></p>

        <summary><em>Republican congressman pressures top universities to disclose unethical foreign investments: July, 2022</em></summary>
        <p>Universities have ‘moral obligation’ not to invest in companies connected to human rights violations, lawmaker says 

<p>A Republican congressman has asked top universities to disclose whether their endowment funds are invested in companies defined by the U.S. as “adversarial entities” because of involvement with human rights abuses in foreign countries.

<p>Congressman Greg Murphy of North Carolina sent a letter June 9 requesting divestment to 15 private colleges and universities with the largest endowments, including Harvard, Princeton and Yale, according to a news release from his office.

<p>Murphy (pictured) gave universities until June 23 to respond to his letter. He is also working on legislation to limit the ability of universities to invest in Chinese companies with unethical business practices.

<p>Murphy’s letter names the Chinese Communist Party and Russia as perpetrators of human rights violations such as “imprisonment of Uyghur Muslims” and “the Russian Federation’s horrific invasion of Ukraine.” According to Murphy, these governments have ties to companies in which colleges should not invest their money.

<p>Since universities “receive the significant benefit of tax-exempt status, they have a moral obligation not to use their endowments to invest in companies that contribute to human rights violations and are detrimental to the national security of the United States,” Murphy stated in the letter.

<p>The College Fix emailed Luke Wallwork, whom the letter requested the universities contact, at Murphy’s office on June 27. Wallwork responded that he forwarded the email to Murphy’s press team on June 28. The Fix was unable to reach the press team or Wallwork after this email.

<p>The Fix also spoke to a staffer by phone at Murphy’s Jacksonville, North Carolina, office on July 6 who said that Murphy was planning to send a second round of letters to the universities, and that the press team would respond that afternoon. The Fix has received no response as of July 6 and was unable to reach Murphy’s D.C. office by phone.

<p>It’s important to hold colleges accountable for their investments, according to one national security expert.

<p>“The [Chinese Communist Party’s] ability and willingness to acquire influence within American higher education is part of a broad ‘whole-of-society’ approach,” Kyle Shideler told The Fix via email.

<p>It’s part of the CCP’s plan to “conduct intelligence and influence operations against the United States,” the Center for Security Policy expert told The Fix.

<p>“Large numbers of investment funds have some, often considerable, exposure to Chinese companies as part of their portfolio,” Shideler wrote. “Thus it’s highly likely that university endowments will have similar exposure.”

<p>Universities confirmed receipt of the letter but have not announced changes

<p>”University spokesperson Jason A. Newton confirmed that Harvard received Murphy’s letter, but declined to comment further,” according to a June 18 article in The Harvard Crimson.

<p>Harvard does not hold direct investments in Russian companies, Newton told The Crimson in March 2022.

<p>Newton told the campus paper, “like all investors, we do not have complete transparency into every investment made by third-party managers, but we believe there are no material indirect holdings with Russian corporations.”

<p>The College Fix reached out to Harvard’s media team three times via email in the last week and asked if the university ever complied with the congressman’s request, which listed June 23 as a deadline, but received no response.

<p>Yale, in a statement in January, before Congressman Murphy sent his letter, stated it “will begin investigating companies in China to determine whether some may be deemed ineligible for Yale investment in light of the Chinese government’s widespread human rights violations.”

<p>“My intuition is that there’ll be a range of activities among companies and that some might be eligible for divestment,” Jonathon Macey, chair of Yale’s Advisory Committee on Investor Responsibility, said in an interview with the Yale Daily News.

<p>The College Fix also reached out to Karen Peart, director of University Media Relations at Yale, over email and asked if the university had any updates on the investigation, but received no response.

<p>The Fix also reached out to Princeton’s Office of Communications over email to ask whether it had complied with Murphy’s letter but received no response. <a href="https://www.thecollegefix.com/republican-congressman-puts-pressure-on-top-universities-to-disclose-unethical-foreign-investments/">Link to site</a></p>

        <summary><em>Doctor founds nonprofit to combat ‘woke ideology’ in medical schools: May 10, 2022</em></summary>
        <p>A doctor and former medical school administrator founded a nonprofit organization in opposition to “anti-racist” initiatives and other ideologies in healthcare, particularly in medical schools.

<p>Dr. Stanley Goldfarb, a former associate dean of curriculum at the University of Pennsylvania’s Perelman School of Medicine, founded “Do No Harm” to unite healthcare workers, policymakers and patients “in a moral mission” to resist ideologies that he argues subvert best practices.

<p>Do No Harm aims to “protect healthcare from a radical, divisive, and discriminatory ideology.”

<p>“Medical providers are increasingly making race a determining factor in who gets what treatments, most notably COVID-19 vaccines,” the Do No Harm FAQ reads. “As Critical Race Theory and anti-racism become more embedded in healthcare, medical professionals will be forced to provide different levels of care to people of different racial and gender groups.”

<p>The initiative points to evidence of radical ideology in schools from sources like criticalrace.org, which cites a large range of schools, from Ivy League institutions to state universities, that now require students take classes either expressly listed as guided by critical race theory or by “anti-racist” principles.

<p>“At least 23 of America’s top 25 medical schools have made anti-racism a core part of their curriculum, while other institutions are creating anti-racist curricula to be implemented at schools nationwide,” the nonprofit states on its website. “This divisive campaign will only lead to discrimination in healthcare, which is bad for patients.”

<p>In a mid-April op-ed in The Wall Street Journal titled ”Keep Politics Out of the Doctor’s Office”, Goldfarb argues radical ideology in healthcare has had negative effects on patient health outcomes.

<p>Goldfarb, in an email interview with The College Fix, said “medical schools are definitely committed to a ‘woke’ ideology.”

<p>He said diversity, equity and inclusion programs are “all the rage,” and added that “schools have committed themselves to antiracist programs. [It’s] hard to know about students and doctors – those data are simply not available.”

<p>Goldfarb flagged “White Coats for Black Lives” as evidence of increasing activism in medical schools. In his op-ed, he described the group as attempting to have “administrators reframe curriculum around reparations for slavery, decarceration of prisoners, and other topics with no bearing on training doctors to care for individual patients.”

<p>The College Fix reached out to the National White Coats for Black Lives three times over the course of the week of April 25 via email asking for comments on Goldfarb’s statements, including his claim that racial health disparities are derived from socioeconomic status and not racism. The group has not responded.

<p>Goldfarb also pointed to specific hospitals as evidence of the use of racial ideology in healthcare by noting that “Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston (Harvard’s teaching hospital) is moving toward ‘preferential care based on race’ across the board.”

<p>The Fix reached out to Brigham and Women’s Hospital on April 29 to ask for comments. Its media representative directed The Fix to a May 2 letter in The Wall Street Journal by Sunil Eappen and Mallika Mendu, the chief and associate chief medical officers at the hospital, written in response to Goldfarb’s op-ed.

<p>Mendu and Eappen denied some of Goldfarb’s claims.

<p>“We are committed to dismantling structures and systems that perpetuate inequities that lead to differential health outcomes,” the letter read. “We are not moving toward preferential care for any group or situation, but rather the opposite: delivering equitable care for everyone in an inclusive environment.”

<p>Eappen and Mendu doubled down on Brigham and Women’s Hospital’s support of the concept of implicit bias as a cause for discrepancies in healthcare outcomes, but acknowledged it was not the only contributing factor.

<p>“The combination of structural, systemic and implicit biases that we all carry is the root of many of the inequities in healthcare… Focusing on explicit bias alone ignores the structural contributors that can be addressed to mitigate disparities,” Eappen and Mendu wrote.

<p>This contradicts the view of Goldfarb, who in an email with The College Fix stated that implicit bias tests and studies are unreliable.

<p>“By assuming the validity of critical race theory, the authors of the study found what they wanted to find rather than a more prosaic cause for the different treatment patterns,” Goldfarb said.

<p>Goldfarb also pointed out that “from 2009 to 2015, four separate meta-analyses came out all suggesting that the [Implicit Association Test] is a weak predictor of discriminating behavior.”

<p>Goldfarb told The Fix that the course of action for someone concerned about the future of healthcare is that “citizens can lobby their elected representatives to hold these institutions to adhere to health care equality and abjure race based health care.”

<p>Undeterred by the backlash he faced on social media, Goldfarb has since expanded upon the ideas contained in that article, channeling them into a new book “Take Two Aspirin and Call Me By My Pronouns: Why Turning Doctors into Social Justice Warriors is Destroying American Medicine.” <a href="https://www.thecollegefix.com/doctor-founds-nonprofit-to-combat-woke-ideology-in-medical-schools/">Link to site</a></p>

        <summary><em>More than $7.2 million spent on COVID tests at 90 percent vaccinated College of the Holy Cross: April 14, 2022</em></summary>
        <p>College said it’s still waiting on federal government reimbursement

<p>The College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Massachusetts, has spent more than $7.2 million over the course of the past two years on COVID testing kits, despite a student body vaccination rate of over 90 percent.

<p>The cost per positive case identified works out to about $6,400, as only 1,100 COVID cases have been identified through campus tests.

<p>The small Catholic college has a total enrollment of 3,000 students and has required students to get tested twice weekly, while faculty and staff are required to test once per week.

<p>The College Fix reached out to the finance department for the exact cost of COVID campus testing. Patricia Maher, associate director for budgets, said the cost is $25 per test.

<p>In total, the university has used over 290,000 tests as of April 13 since the fall of 2020, according to the school’s COVID dashboard. That works out to a cost of $7.25 million.

<p>A member of the university’s COVID Core team said in a school-wide webinar that the federal government reimburses for the cost of testing.

<p>“All of our testing is reimbursed through the [Federal Emergency Management Agency] so it doesn’t impact students, there’s no cost to you or the college,” the staffer said.

<p>The finance office only gave a total estimate of testing costs, including staffing, for the last fiscal year: a total of $4 million spent on testing and staff between June 2020 and June 2021. This means that the total cost of testing as of spring 2022 is likely far higher than $7 million.

<p>Costs will allegedly be reimbursed by FEMA, but the funds have not yet come in

<p>FEMA had yet to reimburse the college for the cost of tests according to a March 28 email from Maher to The Fix.

<p>“[W]e are still working through the reimbursement process [and]…we anticipate the majority of this to be reimbursed by FEMA,” Maher said.

<p>Maher also revealed that to cover the costs that they expect to be reimbursed by FEMA, the college used funds that would have been allocated to departmental operation budgets if the college were not largely shut down.

<p>“We reduced all departmental operating budgets since there was no travel, meals and entertainment, conferences, reduced dining costs, etc., and funds that are held in the college reserve for unforeseen events and planned one time expenses,” Maher stated.

<p>The college only recently decided to lift its masking requirement as of March 17, despite over 90 percent of the student body having received the COVID-19 booster shot. Additionally, 30 percent of the student body has had COVID in the last 90 days, according to the March 17 webinar.

<p>The Fix emailed Maher April 13 for further comment on the reimbursement and has not yet received a response. <a href="https://www.thecollegefix.com/more-than-7-2-million-spent-on-covid-tests-at-90-percent-vaccinated-college-of-the-holy-cross/">Link to site</a></p>
