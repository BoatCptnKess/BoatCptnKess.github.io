        <summary><em>Why We Need More Food Security Assessments (Blog Article)</em></summary>
        <p>In a place like Alaska, where harsh climates limit agricultural activity, food production made costly due to a spread out population, and a vast landscape that hinders transportation, food security is a necessity to ensure that the people of any given region in Alaska are safe from lack of food or anything that may cause a lack of food which could threaten not only peoples health but also their lives. Food security is not just about the quantity of food available but often about the quality of the food and the method with which it was obtained with. Additionally, for Alaskans, especially Alaska Natives, food security is dependent on what is culturally appropriate as well, with some native groups seeing food security as having access to certain subsistence methods like fishing. One may think they are food secure, yet they may very well be one natural disaster or extreme weather event from food shortages. Food security not only covers people who struggle day to day to get food but also people who have food but are one bad week away from not. Feeding America states that 86,970 people or 11.9% of Alaskans are food insecure, which is greater than the population of Juneau and Fairbanks combined. The best way to ensure that you are safe is through understanding your food situation, and the easiest way to do that is through a food security assessment.

<p>Food security assessments essentially examine a specific region's food system. This means the assessment would take into account where the food is coming from, where it is being produced, the average cost compared to other places for the same items, local production, food quality, environmental aspects, and cultural traditions. Looking at all the different factors and using this data, it can then help determine what that individual food system needs as well as what its strengths are, so that the community can use its already established resources to full effect while also looking for new solutions. 

<p>Needs can differ widely, with a place like Anchorage having very different food issues than a smaller community like Nome. For example, because of factors like cost of transportation, feedingamerica.org puts the price of an average meal in Anchorage at $3.37, while that same meal in Nome costs $4.48. Despite this, they may be remarkably similar in certain aspects, like both still having high prices due to the cost of imported goods and dependency on outside producers and processors compared to the lower 48. Because of this, the whole of the United States has an average food price of $3.13, which is far lower than Alaska at $3.63.

<p>A food assessment does not just look at the problems though, it also seeks to find solutions and make recommendations based on current assets and what can be feasibly done. Through these personalized solutions, communities can create action plans to improve their food security, helping the people who live in that region. Often, certain problems have already been tackled by other communities, and so looking at other regions and communities for models to base a program or solution on is a valuable resource, which can also sometimes be found in other regions’ food assessments. These plans and recommendations can go as big as seeking to join a national or state-wide food program or as local as working to create space for a community garden. The versatility of the food security assessments means that there is something to be gained from every community making one.

<p>Having a clear report of issues a community is facing and may face in the future is a crucial step when trying to get outside help. A key point is that it can articulate the problems of that region to others. A food system assessment can give groups like the Alaska Food Policy Council and policymakers something to point to and seek to fix. Without a diagnosis of the problem, it would be nearly impossible to address and fix. Food security assessments are used when writing grants and food policy as evidence of problems and for solutions to those problems. By putting out an assessment, it enables outside entities to have a reason to give funding and support.

<p>While outside funding might be a huge help, food assessments recognize that communities must be on board and part of the solution and that outside help is not always a part of the solution. Often the best solutions can be found solely in the community. This can be seen in local projects, such as creating opportunities for education on subsistence methods or bolstering farmers markets. Additionally, for many tribal groups, a food assessment can be used to best understand how to maintain cultural traditions while also creating a strong food system. In this way, food assessments respect a community's desire to be self-sufficient, allowing for ideas about solutions to be catered to how that individual system would like to operate. This same idea about catered solutions also runs true in discussing a problem. For example, some tribal groups in their food assessments deemphasize the notion of “healthy food”, choosing to calculate their food system on different measures related to their culture and traditions. A food security assessment is an opportunity for a community to lay out its own personal ideas about its food system.

<p>Food security is essential for everybody, and in more spread-out and remote places like Alaska, this can be a serious issue if left unchecked. It is the duty of local leaders to ensure the well-being of their communities, and in doing this, such a crucial idea as establishing a stable and viable food system is a necessity. Food system assessments are the best way to recognize problems, present solutions, organize locally, and receive outside help while still ensuring that it is done on the individual places' own terms. Food systems give communities an extremely useful tool for working towards food security, and AFPC encourages every community and region to work towards having one done and to view these assessments as a living document that changes and grows with your community.</p>

        <summary><em>32ND ALASKA STATE LEGISLATURE (2021-2022): BIG WINS FOR FOOD SECURITY: June 20, 2022</em></summary>
        <p>AS ALWAYS, IT WAS A BUSY LEGISLATIVE SEASON IN JUNEAU! THE SESSION HAS WRAPPED, WE WANTED TO TAKE A MOMENT TO CELEBRATE ALL OF THE BILLS THAT PASSED WHICH AIM TO SUPPORT A MORE RESILIENT FOOD SYSTEM AROUND THE STATE. HERE’S A RECAP OF THOSE BILLS:
<p><b>HB 298</b> will form an Alaska Food Strategy Task Force, a continuation and expansion of Governor Dunleavy’s Food Security & Independence Task Force.

<p>The task force will be comprised of 36 individuals representing various aspects of the food system, including legislators and relevant state commissioners. Notably, the Alaska Food Policy Council has two designated seats on the executive board!

<p>The task force will provide recommendations for strategy and policy on such topics as sustainability in the agriculture industry and local markets, ensuring a good regulatory climate for processors and distributors, addressing food waste, streamlining state-run programs concerning food access and availability, and ensuring food security in all communities in the state.

<p>Additionally, HB 298 establishes a forgivable loan program, where farms can apply for money from a general fund. 

<p>In actuality, this money acts more as a grant with stipulations, as farmers who are recipients of the loan can have the debt of the loan forgiven as long as they implement an approved business plan. This business plan should aim to use the money received from the loan as capital for investments that will build resiliency in the state’s food supply, benefiting everybody. 

<p>This loan can total up to $150,000 and a specific process is outlined to ensure that the farms create improvements with the money before it can be forgiven. Any money not spent, even if approved in the business plan, must be repaid.

<p>This loan program also extends to meat packing plants, which must show some kind of improvements like increased efficiency or quality of meat produced and must be from animals raised in the state to be forgiven. 

<p>This fund promotes improvements for Alaska food producers and processors, seeking to ease dependence on outside food.

<p><b>HB 168</b> establishes a directive for numerous state services and benefits to offer client applications online, for greater efficiency. 

<p>This includes SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, formally known as food stamps), disabled support, and many other assistance programs. 

<p>This will provide greater access for those signing up for these programs as they can now simply sign up within their home, removing barriers, like access to transportation, that can inhibit people from receiving the services they are entitled to.

<p><b>HB 347</b> ensures that animal records held by the Department of Environmental Conservation are to be made confidential, so that private citizens and those government agencies who do not have the authority to do so, are unable to view these records. 

<p>This change seeks to protect trade secrets for businesses, creating an incentive for businesses to innovate while still allowing for regulatory agencies to still do their due diligence. 

<p>The Department of Environmental Conservation will still have access to these records and can distribute them to other departments or agencies if there is a reason to do so.

<p><b>HB 281</b> outlines the budget for the next fiscal year starting on June 30, 2022. The highlights pertaining to food policy and security are as follows: 

<p>$1,250,000 was designated from the Fish and Game Funds to be used for wildlife management surveys and assessments that will seek to provide information that will help enhance food security by understanding the natural fish and game resources.

<p>$3,000,000 was given to the Food Security Agriculture Incentive program which provides funds for the Alaska Division of Agriculture to continue its program of giving grants, loans, and financial incentives for agricultural investment, supporting and growing the food industry in the state. 

<p>$600,000 was dedicated to starting new school breakfast programs and expanding existing ones to ensure that children who may not have access to breakfast at home get the food they need in the morning, providing a level of food security for children. 

<p>$10,000,000 was given to Food Bank of Alaska for infrastructure capacity for Alaska’s statewide food assistance network.

<p>$500,000 was designated for the Alaska Farmers Market Association, which helps ensure that farmers markets are able to operate effectively as they provide a space for people to exchange local food products, benefiting local farmers and helping to establish a local food system that can resist outward changes. This funding will be used to provide double SNAP, WIC, and SFMNP benefits at markets statewide.

<p>A very special thanks to all the many people who worked tirelessly to ensure these priorities were heard by our decision-makers, including the Food Bank of Alaska, the Alaska Food Coalition, the Alaska Farm Bureau, the Alaska Farmers Market Association, Alaska Farmland Trust, Intertribal Agriculture Counil, Alaska Food Policy Council, and many more.
