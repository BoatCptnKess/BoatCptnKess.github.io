        <summary><em>The Fauci Complex: August 1, 2022</em></summary>
        <p>The one-sided Holy Cross love story continues as President Rougeau announced over email that Anthony S. Fauci, M.D. ‘62, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), will have the Holy Cross Integrated Science Complex named in his honor this coming June. I find this decision to be incredibly premature, and I believe it sets a bad precedent for the future by essentially endorsing individuals before their careers have even been concluded. In the announcement email, President Rougeau also emphasized Holy Cross’s commitment to social justice, which accompanies a number of earlier commitments to anti-racism. Yet, Holy Cross has decided to name another place on campus after a white man, snubbing a notable black alumnus, Clarence Thomas. Fauci has produced questionable Covid-19 policies and is actively involved in certain controversies that are yet to be resolved. His record should be allowed to be scrutinized over time to properly demonstrate what his legacy shall be.</p>

<p>This announcement came far too early as Fauci is still a very active participant in affairs that many would consider partisan. His oversight of US government decision-making during the pandemic has resulted in many questionable decisions that lack substantial reasoning and have no consideration for other factors like mental health and quality of life. I covered this issue more extensively last semester in the Fenwick Review and would advise all those who are interested to read that article. 

<p>Additionally, Fauci is still under substantial scrutiny concerning NIH funding of suspect research overseas, and the possibility of a cover-up is a critical concern at this moment in time. With news stories that look bad for the media's agenda being suppressed and labeled as fake news, most notably the Hunter Biden laptop story,  begs the question if certain right-wing anti-Fauci “conspiracies” are really conspiracies, or reality. If Fauci is untrustworthy, then the media cannot push its Covid agenda. Thus, Fauci’s image must be protected, and stories about Fauci that do not paint him in a good light are labeled as fake news.

<p>One example of a controversy relating to the experiments Fauci’s NIAID has funded involves suspicious use of fetal tissue and its unconfirmed origins. Even though I believe there is still a lot to be explored with these controversies and that they should be taken with a grain of salt, they are concerning nonetheless and deserved to be explored. The first example is that Fauci’s NIAID reportedly gave $400,000 to the University of Pittsburgh to perform an experiment where human fetal skin is grafted on the rib cages of mice to measure the hair growth. Many claim that the skin for the experiment was taken from the scalps of aborted babies. This experiment represents just one of many potential blots on Fauci’s legacy that have yet to be fully examined.

<p>Another example that has been presumably disproved by fact-checkers, yet doubt still remains due to the apparent untruthfulness that the media has displayed in the past, is that Fauci, through the NIAID, sent funding to a lab in Tunisia where inhumane experiments that would not be allowed in the United States were performed on Beagles. In these experiments, beagles’ heads were put in cages to which sand flies were introduced to eat the dogs’ heads. After a bipartisan letter requested answers it was claimed that the NIAID was falsely attributed as a funder of this experiment although skepticism remains. The point here is not that Fauci was complicit in these inhumane actions, but that Fauci is still an evolving figure, whose legacy has not been fully decided yet. Holy Cross should not make any rash decisions for the sake of being able to advertise the Fauci complex on campus tours.

<p>Two larger issues also concern Fauci as a figure of admiration. The first issue is the use of gain-of-function research. During testimony on this subject, Fauci clearly and deliberately lied and misled congress members conducting oversight. The question of the NIAID's use of gain-of-function research was raised by Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) in May of last year, where Fauci concretely asserted that “We did not fund gain-of-function research in the Wuhan Institute of Virology.” Gain-of-function research is controversial because it is research that increases the transmissibility and/or virulence of a pathogen, generally involving its transmissibility towards humans, and could result in a virus that could be a pandemic-level threat if done improperly and dangerously. It was not till October 20th of last year that Fauci’s claims were disproved by a letter sent to Congress by the NIH, the parent organization of Fauci’s NIAID, which stated that gain-of-function research was funded and did occur in the Wuhan Institute of Virology by the NIAID. As of April of this year, Rand Paul has noted to the press that 11 yes or no questions related to gain-of-function research were given to Fauci in January that have still not been answered, pointing to a clear case of stonewalling of congressional oversight.

<p>This first controversy segues into the lab leak theory; the second big controversy that will undoubtedly become more clear with time. The lab leak theory postulates that COVID-19 was in some way created in a lab and then somehow released into the public, resulting in the deaths of millions from COVID-19. The concern with Fauci is that his NIAID funded the gain-of-function research that took place on coronaviruses in bats at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, and with a bat from Wuhan having been determined to be the origin of the virus, much concern is raised about the possibility of Fauci and the NIAID’s involvement in the creation of COVID-19. While I highly doubt that Fauci and the NIAID deliberately created that COVID-19 virus, the research done in Wuhan with the Chinese scientists under the authority of the Chinese Communist Party raises great concern. Seeing how Fauci lied about the NIAID’s involvement in gain-of-function research, the idea that Fauci may be lying about the origins of COVID-19 to protect himself is concerning and should be given greater scrutiny. Fauci’s legacy is still up in the air, and if internal emails or other evidence are revealed in the future that confirms suspicions about misconduct around experiments that Fauci’s NIAID funded, the College would be in a terrible position.

<p>One might ask why this needed to be done. Did the science complex really even need a name in the first place? If Holy Cross is choosing to set a precedent for naming complexes after currently acting important figures, who have yet to finish their careers, then I request that President Rougeau name the complex consisting of O’Kane, Fenwick, Smith, and the Brooks Concert Hall the Thomas Complex, in order to honor United States Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. Thomas is currently the longest-serving justice on our nation's highest court, having held his position for 30 years and is a Holy Cross Alumni class of 1971, and has had a long career of originalist and textualist interpretation of the constitution. Thomas has rejected the notion of legislating from the bench, unlike other activist judges who seek to make policy through their decisions, and through this has stood up for the rights enshrined in the constitution for three decades.

<p>Through dedicating this building to Justice Thomas, Holy Cross can take a step to make good on its policy of “anti-racism” and social justice by dedicating an unnamed complex to an esteemed and accomplished black civil servant who could give black students on campus representation that a complex named after another white man cannot give. Naming the complex after Justice Thomas would then accompany Healy residence hall as the only other building on campus named after a black man, even though it is noted that Healy identified and passed as white during his lifetime. During his time at Holy Cross, Justice Thomas helped found the Black Student Union on campus and stood up against a racist Holy Cross administration during a walkout to protest unfair treatment. Despite my request, I would rather see that neither man is honored on campus just yet, as the two are still evolving figures, whose legacies can still be shaped dramatically.

<p>All in all, Fauci is fundamentally a political figure at this point in time, just like Justice Thomas, and setting the precedent of naming buildings or complexes after still active figures is a premature action to take. By naming the entire science complex after Fauci, other names within the science complex are minimized, and by using his name, Holy Cross appears to endorse every action that Fauci undertakes, some of which have yet to take place. It is clear that Fauci has done significant work in his field, much of which he should be applauded for, but certain controversies have yet to be resolved, and certain information has yet to be revealed, particularly about the pandemic. In this way, Fauci is still a polarizing figure, and any dedication to him should be postponed until his full history and legacy are made apparent over time. <a href="https://www.thefenwickreview.com/archive/2022/8/1/the-fauci-complex">Link to site</a></p>

        <summary><em>Toxic Elitism and a Defense of the Uneducated: March 10, 2022</em></summary>
        <p>Being born and raised in Alabama and now attending a New England liberal arts college, I stand at an interesting intersection of viewpoints between two groups that often talk of each other in American discourse, but never seem to really understand each other. These two groups are the liberal educated elites and those who have been labeled the populist uneducated Trump supporters. I do not believe it is fair to label them as simply Trump supporters, because their ideology is bigger than just Trump, but he has embodied the idea so well in the last few years that that is what they have been referred to by academics and the media.

<p>The contention between these two groups is inflamed by the media that has enjoyed showing maps over the past few years comparing those without college degrees to those with college degrees. The media then chooses to make it a point of discussion and often a problem. While there is no issue with presenting these facts, the media chooses to focus on them to a point of obsession, trying to plant in the minds of the American people that we simply must educate the masses for four more years after highschool in order to usher in a new Democratic utopia. This appears to be the mindset of the liberal elites.

<p>From my experience there is no greater place to learn about the educated liberal elite mindset than from inside the walls of many of this country's colleges and universities. Fundamentally, I have found, through listening to my college professors, that the stance of many academics on the psychology of what we will call Trump supporters can be summarized by the concept of politics of resentment.

<p>Politics of resentment is the concept that every position that these so-called “uneducated” Trump supporters take on an issue is only adopted because they wish to oppose the educated elite. Their motivation, therefore, is that the Trump supporters resent the educated and their elitist attitudes towards them. An example I was given in class was that it was said that Trump supporters only support protections on gun rights because they resent the elites trying to impose restrictions. Their opposition is then presumed not from a perception of tyranny, but rather because they resent the elites because they are jealous of their status and power. In this way, the liberal elites see themselves as the concerned parent who has to take away or control something, for example a cellphone, because as the parent they know better and should be trusted to do so for the betterment of the child.

<p>This idea attempts to ignore any other reason a Trump supporter might support gun rights, such as for hunting, protection from criminals with guns, or most importantly as a means to defend oneself against a tyrannical government. Additionally, in our now intersectional world, this concept has been tied to racism and white supremacy, with claims that Trump supporters do not support woke notions like implicit racial bias simply because they wish to rebel against the elites. I encourage those interested in the concept to simply search ‘politics of resentment’ or even ‘uneducated Trump supporters’ and look at the alarming number of support and discussion of the largely academic concept online.

<p>To be clear, I do not see uneducated as an insult, simply as a distinction that someone has not received a college education, and would prefer a different term to be used because it is in fact extraordinarily rare to find someone who is completely uneducated in the US. Instead uneducated has come to mean those who have not received a college degree. This statement in and of itself is very concerning, considering the vast majority of those we call uneducated in America have gone through 13 years of schooling and received a highschool diploma or underwent the efforts to get a GED. Instead though, this idea of politics of resentment shows us that many of these liberal elites, whether they will admit it or not, see a college degree as a license to have an opinion. Without this distinction that requires you to attend a four year college or university, and for most pay thousands of dollars, you are not allowed to have a valid opinion as you have not been taught how to think by an accredited institution. 

<p>The issue with this line of thinking is that the ability to think and to reason is not dependent on a college degree. Someone born to a rich family may be able to be pushed through a bachelor's degree program while someone from a poorer background may elect to enter a trade due to financial concerns, even if the individual from the poorer background has the capabilities to excel in a college setting. I would even go so far as to argue that a college education has little to no bearing on how rational one’s political opinions are. The problem with the college curriculum is that it often deals in theory and ideals and rarely in practice and application. Those who enter college are often taught idealistic philosophies that can often fall under Marxist or utopian umbrellas from professors who subscribe to the ideas of liberal elites, while those who don’t attend college are forced to see the real world and the realities that come with that. These people often do not gain the idealistic perspective of changing the world that is purveyed to many college students.

On the flip side of this contention, I can often say that many of these “uneducated” Trump supporters have a bad take on many issues, and while I often agree with them politically, I agree for different reasons. Despite this, they still clearly have reasons for which they have their opinions. These reasons may not be as nuanced as a political science student who has studied the issues extensively, but the question can still be asked: how much do we actually talk about the relevant issues in college political science classes? During my 2 ½ years as a political science major, we have never once talked about important issues in the modern American landscape, like abortion or gun control, in any serious capacity, only side references by professors which usually indicate their political leanings.

<p>It is clear that a college education oftentimes does not give you more reasons or evidence to pull upon for the many important issues, but instead the ability to convey that information more effectively. Every class I have taken at Holy Cross under the political science umbrella has had me write at least two essays, generally more, to which I am judged on how well I can rhetorically craft an argument. From my experience, these essays have never been about the issues that politicians care about, though there may be rare exceptions. Instead, the essays focus on topics like the pros and cons of certain party systems or the different philosophies around the idea of a social contract. The bulk of what colleges teach on politics is about structure rather than the issues. This is the focus of a liberal arts education, to which those who distinguish between educated and uneducated in such a vitriolic manner judge others by. The emphasis in a liberal arts education on crafting arguments is not to rationalize one’s opinions, but rather to convince others. Those who lack this education may not be able to articulate their ideas as well, but that does not mean that they do have them. They may not be equipped to run the system as elected officials, but they are certainly equipped to vote on them competently. <a href="https://www.thefenwickreview.com/archive/2022/3/10/toxic-elitism-and-a-defense-of-the-uneducated">Link to site</a></p>

        <summary><em>Holy Cross Should Take No Pride in Fauci: November 22,2021</em></summary>
        <p>Looking at the long list of College of the Holy Cross alumni, many names pop out as being very accomplished individuals. Such names as Bob Cousey, a basketball great, Jon Favreau, an accomplished writer who worked as a speechwriter for President Obama, and Clarence Thomas, associate justice of the United States Supreme Court. Despite these well-accomplished people, one man stands in front as the pride of Holy Cross, that being Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the Chief Medical Advisor to the President. Despite his de facto status as the pride of Holy Cross, he is the least deserving of the lot, advocating policies that infringe on the American people’s freedoms, like vaccine mandates, and lying to the American public, most nobly in the case of gain-of-function research and the NIH’s involvement with the Wuhan Institute of Virology.

<p>The name Anthony Fauci first entered the collective American vocabulary in the spring of 2020, when he came to be who Americans looked towards for information on the COVID-19 Pandemic. Students of Holy Cross, having just been sent home due to the pandemic, rallied behind Fauci in an effort to gain that connection to the school who’s campus that had just been separated from. Soon, the Instagram trend “Fauci Friday” gained traction, where students would photoshop Fauci into pictures of them and their friends from before the pandemic and put it on their Instagram stories. Unfortunately, Fauci has proved over his time being the face of the COVID-19 Pandemic that he is not a man who should be celebrated.

<p>Since that time, Fauci has become less of a public health policy maker, and more of a talking head for the masses, appearing in interview after interview — some serious, many not — to the point where many on the Left have given him cult status, all while he collects his salary of $417,608 a year, the highest of any federal worker, including the president. It has become commonplace for merchandise to be sold with his face on it, like pillows or bobble heads. Of course one must ask, “What has he actually done to receive this much praise?” Some may point to his earlier work on the HIV/AIDS epidemic that was essential in many ways, for which he received the presidential medal of freedom. Of course, this should be commended, but in terms of his leadership during the COVID-19 Pandemic, it has been marred by bad policy, conflict, and lies.

<p>First, concerning the policies that Fauci has espoused and approved of, many would point to his flip-flopping statements regarding both the danger of COVID-19 as well as his stance on masks as worthy of criticism. On both issues he changed his opinion in the first few months of the pandemic, but I would not point to this as a failure as others would. It is important to acknowledge that science is an ever-evolving field where the answers on which we once agreed as the truth are not always the ones we find to be true later. In this same vein though, vaccine skepticism is surely justified since science is ever evolving, and the vaccine being seen as beneficial by science now, might change in the future. I do not support anti-vaccine rhetoric, but the point is that science is not as cut in stone as the so-called “experts” make it out to be. It is reasonable to be suspicious of a new, somewhat rushed vaccine, under an administration which, before it took office, blasted the vaccine as untrustworthy. Despite this, Fauci still supports the overarching policy of vaccine mandates.

<p>Fauci’s policies limit the freedom of Americans by supporting policies that compel them to have a substance that they find untrustworthy injected into them. Fauci would point to the idea that public health trumps freedom in this case, meaning that you may have skepticism about the vaccine, but by not taking the vaccine you run the risk of killing others through spreading the disease. This argument has very little merit though when one looks at the data comparing the deaths of vaccinated vs unvaccinated Americans. Andy Slavitt, a former adviser to the Biden administration on COVID-19, noted that 98% to 99% of those who died in May from COVID-19 were unvaccinated, and with a vaccine for which we have near universal access in America, excluding children for which the virus poses an extremely minimal threat, this leads to the conclusion that the unvaccinated do not pose a threat to the vaccinated. Why are we trying to save those who do not want to be saved? The United States is a nation constructed to stand against tyranny. This means that, in America, one should have the right to refuse a vaccine, as at this point in the pandemic, the only one that they stand to hurt is themselves. If they choose to risk their lives in this way, that is their choice, similar to how a smoker has the right to smoke, despite increasing his chance of cancer by huge margins.

<p>Fauci’s policies may fly in the face of freedom, but the most disgraceful act that Fauci has undertaken in his time as America’s doctor are his actions related to the lies regarding gain-of-function research in Wuhan. In an exchange in May between Fauci and Senator Rand Paul (R-KY), Fauci said that “We did not fund gain-of-function research in the Wuhan Institute of Virology.” Wuhan, and the Wuhan Institute of Virology, is the theorized origin of the virus. Gain-of-function research is research that increases the transmissibility and/or virulence of a pathogen, generally involving its transmissibility towards humans.

<p>On October 20th, this claim was utterly debunked by the National Institute of Health (NIH), of which Fauci’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) is a part, when they sent a letter to Congress admitting that gain-of-function research did occur in the Wuhan Institute of Virology. The letter details that at least $600,000 was given to EcoHealth, an American-based group who used that money, along with researchers in Wuhan, to study bat coronaviruses. This completely contradicts Fauci’s categorical denial that this type of research occured, despite Fauci working under NIH.

<p>The NIH blames the EcoHealth group, claiming that the appearance of a new highly contagious form of the coronavirus was not reported to them until August of this year. Either Fauci lied and the NIH revealed that lie; or Fauci had no clue what was occurring under the supervision of his own agency; or there is a much larger cover up, possibly involving the origins of COVID-19 and the United States government’s role in it. This comes after an increasing amount of skepticism whether the coronavirus lab leak theory is really as debunked as Fauci would like to make it seem. 

<p>Fauci has, time and again, decried the lab leak theory. And while the majority of government agencies still maintain either that the origin is uncertain or that it is natural (notably with self-reported low confidence), an increasing number of news organizations and even one US government intelligence agency has come to the conclusion that the lab leak theory is the most likely origin. Of course, geopolitical concerns are undoubtedly in the back of the minds of Fauci and the NIH. These concerns include not upsetting the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), similar to how the Director-General of the World Health Organization refused to criticize the CCP in fear that it would not cooperate with the pandemic response, despite its repeated efforts to undermine the information gathering process. It is clear that the CCP has no intention of cooperating and has no consideration for the rest of the world, yet Fauci still chooses to put his trust in them and their scientists.

<p>The CCP has shown repeatedly that it can not be trusted, yet Fauci’s NIAID and the NIH still continue to fund research in China and other foreign countries with suspect ethics. These places do not have the same regulations and safety precautions regarding experiments, and so they are ideal places to conduct dangerous and ethically questionable research. They can claim some degree of plausible deniability as they have done through EcoHealth and its gain-of-function research in Wuhan. Why try to do this research in an American lab with ethical standards, when you could do it in China with no concerns and the ability to blame it on someone else if you leak the most dangerous virus in a century?

<p>Additionally, at the time of this writing, a new story is emerging that Fauci, through the NIH, sent funding to a Tunisian laboratory conducting inhumane experiments on beagles. According to White Coat Waste Project, a bipartisan organization that seeks to end taxpayer-funded experiments on animals, Fauci’s NIAID sent $424,000 to a Tunisian laboratory that undertook experiments where beagles’ heads were put in cages to which sand flies were introduced to eat the dogs’s heads. This story is still developing, so it should be treated with a fair amount of skepticism, but it is concerning nonetheless.

<p>While many on campus take pride in Dr. Anthony Fauci as a Holy Cross alumnus, he has proven, especially through his most recent actions, that he should not be celebrated. His deliberate disregard for freedom in exchange for questionable policy is nonetheless ignored and sometimes even encouraged by his supporters. The cult-like following he has garnered, not just on campus, but in America as a whole, is concerning. Fueled by fanaticism, the very real concerns of suspect research are thrown out the window as nonsense conspiracy theories, rather than concerning and possibly criminal allegations which should be investigated further. Holy Cross should take no pride in Fauci. <a href="https://www.thefenwickreview.com/archive/2021/11/22/holy-cross-should-take-no-pride-in-fauci">Link to site</a></p>

        <summary><em>Social Media and the Abortion Debate: October 11, 2021</em></summary>
        <p>On September 1st, 2021, Senate Bill 8 in the state of Texas went into effect. This bill created a set of parameters that was able to circumvent the language used in previous judicial decisions that allowed greater access to abortion. Since this bill was sent to the floor of the Texas Senate, and even more so after it became law, social media sites like Instagram and Twitter have run amuck with various arguments and points that are widely held but lack reason. I will be addressing a few of those here.

<p>Instagram stories, from my experience, especially in the wake of George Floyd's death, have become a breeding ground for coarse opinions and flashy-looking infographics. The activist infographic is commonplace on Instagram, where its creators make several slides and write, usually in a bubbly font and pastel colors, slogans and ideas (sometimes with supporting evidence). If you are unfamiliar with what I am referring to, the Instagram account @impact is a good example of this type of content at the time of this writing. A quick search on Instagram under #abortionrights finds the following arguments that I will be addressing here.

<p>“Men shouldn't be making laws about women’s bodies.” This argument is used to invalidate any male’s pro-life opinion by saying that since abortion and unwanted pregranacy is an issue that only affects women, men lack the empathy and relevancy to govern and legislate this issue. This is in the same vein as those who believe that only those of certain races or backgrounds can speak on certain issues because of their lived experience. This is wrong and, in this case, sexist. Rather than address the arguments of the opposition, they try to invalidate them as being incapable of having a productive thought. This argument also completely ignores the 45% of women who support some restrictions to abortion and 19% of women who support a total ban on aboriton according to data collected by Gallup in 2021. These numbers are strikingly similar to male opinions on the subject, meaning sex plays less of a role in abortion opinions than implied by this argument. If men took a step back from the abortion debate and let women handle it, the outcome would most likely not change.

<p>“The pro-life movement is rooted in racism.” I have seen this argument presented in many different ways. The most compelling Instagram infographic used sources from NPR, Politico, and The Atlantic to make their case. It is predicated on the idea that evangelicals in the 1980s were angry about desegregation and only picked up the issue of abortion in order to gain more votes and galvanize support for their agenda. To show the lack of relevance of this argument, one must only look at the modern data. The CDC reports that in the United States, black women had the highest ratio of abortions out of any racial group with 335 abortions per 1,000 live births as opposed to white women with 110 per 1,000 live births. Black women get abortions at more than 3 times the rate of white women. If an individual or group were racist, why would they seek a policy that aims to disproportionately save the lives of black babies? If this was truly the intention, those supposed racists would be in favor of abortion since fewer black babies would be born, leading to a demographic shift, with the final result being fewer black individuals eventually turning 18 and using their right to vote. In modern times, the pro-life movement seeks to save people of all backgrounds, debunking these all too prevalent accusations of racism, stemming from the arbritary claim of a racist past rather than any claims about the present.

<p>“Pro-lifers are only pro-life until it is out of the womb.” This argument is usually coupled with the accusation that those who are pro-life are really only “pro-birth”, seeing that those who are pro-life are also generally conservative and reject the concept of large government welfare programs. This idea infers that in order to not simply be pro-birth, one has to support large government assistance and in turn support the use of a greater tax burden to accomplish that. The reason why this is false is because there is more than one way to assist people in need. Those on the right of the political spectrum find the best way is not to fund bloated and bureaucratic government agencies that mismanage funds, but rather to give their money to religious groups and private charities. They find religious groups like their church more appealing as a destination for their money because they generally know to whom they are giving the money and can hold them accountable, with the faith that the money will go to a good cause due to a common set of values. Private charities are similar in that they can be held to greater accountability than a bureaucratic agency. If a charity acts in a manner that does not reflect what individuals believe the charity should be doing, those individuals can choose not to give them money. That cannot be said about the government, which is held accountable to government officials who are laden with other responsibilities as well as limited by lengthy procedure. To respond to the claim, many pro-lifers find that private means are better than public means in assisting those out of the womb. The difference is that conservatives want to use their own money to support causes of import, while those on the left want to take others' money and allocate it as they see fit.

<p>“Pro-lifers only want to control women’s bodies.” This claim seeks to invalidate any argument as it simplifies the situation into pro-lifers arguing in bad faith. Anything that a pro-lifer says can be discarded because they do not believe what they are saying, or have ulterior motives. Rather than addressing the ideas put forth, this argument simply assumes the opposition is evil and not worthy of debate. To come to this conclusion, one has to assume that pro-lifers do not actually believe that unborn babies are alive, and therefore rather than protect life, wish to control others. Contrary to this, pro-lifers do genuinely believe in what they say, and are only seeking to protect innocent human life. This claim is lazy at best and conspiratorial at worst, implying that there are vast swaths of the population bent on controlling women by all agreeing to lie about the same thing. I would never assume that a large group of people that I disagree with politically were being disingenuous despite them having legitimate arguments that suggest otherwise, and neither should anyone else because it does not lead to productive conversation and will never convince anyone who is governed by reason. It only seeks to breed division. 

<p>Finally “it is none of your business” or “if you are against abortion don’t have one.” To believe someone is being murdered next door is none of my business? The vast majority of those on the left as well as many on the right believe George Floyd was murdered, but is that any of your business? Are white straight cisgender men not allowed to march for Black Lives Matter because they are not affected by alleged systematic abuse and not a part of their intersectionality umbrella? No, of course not. People support causes because they believe it is the right thing to do. Martin Luther King Jr., a man widely revered and quoted in America by both left and right, famously said, “Injustice anywhere is injustice everywhere.” Abortion is an injustice, just like those on the left assert that systematic racism — which they believe to be enshrined in most, if not all, institutions — is an injustice, and it is every person’s imperative to fight for justice, even if one thinks it does not affect them. Abortion is murder, and I and many others are not going to sit by and let it happen.

<p>This article, of course, does not get the opportunity to address the real substantive questions on abortion, such as when does life begin, Catholicism’s view on abortion, or the nuances of cases surrounding rape, incest, or when the mother’s life is in danger. These questions have all been answered before either by previous writers for The Fenwick Review or by other commentators on the topic. Here, I only sought to address the many lazy and coarse opinions spouted on social media that I see take away from the real debate. Additionally, not all those who are for abortion accessibility believe these views, as no group is a monolith. These flashy statements should be retired, so that we as a society can engage in a civil discourse that leads to the truth, rather than shouting matches and political theatre governed by emotions and fanaticism.<a href="https://www.thefenwickreview.com/archive/2021/10/11/social-media-and-the-abortion-debate">Link to site</a></p>

        <summary><em>The Death Penalty: A Modern Conundrum: May 12, 2020</em></summary>
        <p>I am a pro-life Republican, and I mean pro-life in all senses of the word. Catholic conservatives today face the question of whether society and government should sanction the death penalty. The Republican party platform as it currently stands supports the death penalty whereas the Catholic Church officially opposes it. There are a number of different arguments against the death penalty, whether from the point of economics or the perspective of liberalism, but I come to argue on the grounds of modern conservative ideology and Catholic theology.

<p>The most compelling case against the death penalty from the Bible comes from the Ten Commandments. In these, God gave the Israelites a set of rules to live their lives by in a very simple form. The 6th command says ‘Thou shalt not kill.’ In a very blunt straight to the point statement, God says that you cannot kill. God does not then provide instances where one would be allowed to kill others. God does not then say that if someone breaks this commandment that one is then permitted to break it again with capital punishment. God simply says that you cannot kill and Jesus reaffirms this in the New Testament in Matthew 19:18 when he says ‘You shall not murder.’ However, this then raises the question: is self-defense allowed, and if so, is capital punishment a form of self-defense?

<p>One of the best distinctions I have come across to alleviate the complexity of this situation is to divide self-defense into three separate categories. Personal self-defense is the defense of oneself such as against a home intruder. National self-defense would be to defend your nation through war. Social self-defense is the use of lethal force to protect society, for example, executing criminals that are a danger to society; this is one of the examples someone in the pro-death penalty camp might use to justify their beliefs. All of these forms of self-defense are allowed in Catholicism, but the problem in the instance of social self-defense is that in a modern society like the United States, once these people are arrested, they are no longer considered a threat to society. They are put into a level of security in prison where they are with criminals who committed similar crimes. Any act of capital punishment that is used against these murderers by the state is then unjust since they pose almost no threat to society in such a state. Today, these maximum security prisons, where murderers are housed in, have reduced escapes to nearly zero. Someone who is convicted and sentenced to death should instead have a life prison sentence to contemplate the sin he has committed and then, hopefully, repent.

<p>However, this does mean that execution would be allowed just because someone poses a threat to society This is only the case in a society that is not modern, unlike the United States. In medieval Europe where life was much more chaotic and less safe, it is reasonable why one might execute someone as they could pose a legitimate danger to society, which is permitted by the Catholic Church. Additionally, in a tribal setting, where one does not have the means to detain people, it would be a wise choice to execute a serial killer. These do not conflict with Catholicism, but needless killing does.

<p>Americans are not seeking the death penalty to protect society, as those that receive the death penalty would otherwise spend their life in prison. Instead, many Americans seek the death penalty for revenge. This was made blatantly evident when anti-death penalty candidate Michael Dukakis, in his 1988 run for president, was asked in a debate whether he would support the death penalty if his wife was raped and murdered. In response, he stood by his principle, and calmly explained why he would say “no.” This was seen as a gaffe by many, but the most notable point that arose from the exchange is the question’s key revelation as to the American outlook on the death penalty. Dukakis was not asked whether the man was a danger to society, but whether he would personally want to seek revenge for the rape and murder of his wife. It is made very clear in the Bible that seeking revenge is prohibited, for God will give what every person deserves on Judgment Day.

<p>Despite the aforementioned arguments, I find the secular arguments in situations like these to be even more compelling, especially as pertaining to secular nations. As a conservative, the question of how much power the government should have always comes to mind when discussing politics, and the death penalty is no different. An argument against the death penalty is an argument for limited government. The government should not be given the ultimate power to choose whether people live or die. In the American spirit of standing against tyranny, for the people to willingly give the government the power to kill,while the people have no such power, is a very dangerous choice. For the same reason one might support the Second Amendment to ensure that the government can never become tyrannical, one should never support the death penalty and the life or death power that those who support it entrust in the government.

<p>Government has a long history of being ineffective at doing certain tasks, and this is why centrally planned economies, government-run health care, and socialism are all opposed by American conservatives. States such as the Soviet Union have shown the government’s ineffectiveness in excessively managing the functions of everyday life and operations. This shows in the United States through the justice system, with the widely agreed statistic that 4% of convictions are false, including those sentenced to capital punishment. This would mean that the government has the right to kill, and indeed has killed, innocent people. This should scare anyone, for that the United States government has the capability to kill you and anyone you know through a false conviction.

<p>For clarification, I do not believe that the United States is in immediate threat of devolving into a tyrannical regime, but I do believe that if certain powers are not safeguarded in a way that prevents the state from excessively exercising them, then we run the risk of dangerously expanding government power. Prominent Democrats that have gained national support in presidential campaigns such as Beto O'Rourke have put out a proposal for a mandatory gun buyback program for what he would classify as ‘assault weapons.’ American conservatives would agree that this would be a gross overreach of power and that it would limit the American public’s ability to protect themselves from state tyranny. But, when the similar issue arises of allowing state-sponsored murder that could fall on innocent people, many do not have a problem.

<p>The death penalty in a modern society is state-sponsored murder prohibited by the Bible. The American public justifies this by seeking revenge against those convicted who are now rendered contained and helpless at the whim of the government. The death penalty has no place in a modern society that could devolve into tyranny and totalitarianism, and should not be tolerated by those who seek to act in a Godly way or those who fear tyrannical government power that has plagued human history. <a href="https://www.thefenwickreview.com/archive/2020/5/12/the-death-penalty-a-modern-conundrum">Link to site</a></p>

        <summary><em>The Internet's Obsession: Andrew Yang's UBI: February 6, 2020</em></summary>
        <p>It is a common talking point of those on the right to accuse those on the left of advocating for giving away free stuff or services in exchange for votes. This can be seen with much of the Democratic Party calling for free healthcare or free college. One Democratic presidential candidate, Andrew Yang, who remains low in the polls, takes this idea of free stuff a step further and offers a Universal Basic Income (UBI), which he has ever-so-patriotically named the “Freedom Dividend.” There are a number of problems I see with UBI that I would like to express here. 

 <p>Firstly, I see the need to clarify what a Universal Basic Income actually is. UBI is a system, usually replacing existing welfare but not always, that gives a periodic payment to all citizens without exception for wealth status. This means that whether you are unemployed, making $100,000 a year, or a billionaire, you will always receive a set amount of money usually on a monthly basis. Andrew Yang’s UBI takes the form of the Freedom Dividend, which aims to give $1,000 a month, totaling $12,000 a year, to every American citizen over the age of 18.

 <p>One of the biggest problems for a national UBI in the United States is on the grounds of implementation: the United States is very large and diverse and the cost of living varies wildly, with $1,000 in my home state of Alabama having a much different purchasing power than the same amount of money in New York, but under Yang’s program, an individual in either place would receive the same amount of monthly income from the UBI. The only way around this in the U.S. would be to implement UBI policies on the state level, but that would require an initiative by each state to implement, which is highly unlikely and impractical.

 <p>Another problem is that the UBI might not even be enough to serve its desired purpose as a safety net. If one of the goals of the UBI is to create a job market where people have the freedom to leave or lose their jobs without the fear of becoming homeless, $1,000 in some places might not be enough. If someone has no savings and no means of getting more money and no longer has a job, $1,000 in the big cities where many people live is most likely less than what they were living on before, thereby creating a situation where someone may not be able to afford the housing they are in, which still pressures them to keep maintain their current job.

 <p>This all comes with the looming problem of the inevitable inflation that would come from Yang’s method of payment for this program. Yang would tax businesses to pay for his UBI, which will inevitably raise prices and cause inflation. On his campaign website, though, he claims that consumers are “price sensitive” and that those producers will simply find more efficient ways to produce goods. Yang’s UBI will not have any effect on the rate of efficiency that companies operate at, and if companies are faced with an increased cost of production and are presented with a set of consumers who now have more disposable income, they will most certainly raise their prices. The cost of taxes put on businesses are always passed down to the consumer.

 <p>The biggest problem that comes with Andrew Yang’s Freedom Dividend is not the UBI itself, but rather his method of payment for such a costly program. According to what appears to be Yang’s conservative estimate, giving each American over the age of 18 $1,000 a month would cost about $2.8 trillion. To pay for this, he proposes a European-style value-added tax, coupled with an assumption that because of each person receiving an additional $1,000 a month, certain metrics that cost the American government will go down.

 <p>Yang claims on his campaign website that, miraculously, people will “Be better able to take care of themselves and avoid the emergency room, jail, and the street and would generally be more functional,” all by simply giving them $1,000 a month. This may be true on some level, but just like how giving food aid to Somalia rather than giving Somalians the means to make their own food puts a bandaid on the issue of starvation, the UBI simply provides Americans with a fixed income rather than giving them the means to provide for themselves.

 <p>The two final ways Yang claims to pay for his program are by the miraculous creation of new revenue from his UBI and the implementation of additional taxes. Though his UBI would create more revenue, this is only because of the major inflation that his program would cause, which would make this same money worth less. Additionally, he proposes even more taxes such as a carbon tax along with stricter taxing of capital gains, both of which would be hindrances on business and raise prices.

 <p>In order to cut spending, Yang makes his UBI and other forms of welfare such as food stamps mutually exclusive, meaning that if you choose to take part in the famously effective program of food stamps, you won’t get your $1,000. There is a reason why the U.S. government chooses to give people stamps tradable for food, and that is because it is effective in helping those who have trouble with money management and impulse control on purchases. If everyone was a savvy consumer, we would not need food stamps as we could just give money directly to the individuals. Disability payments are also on this mutually exclusive list. We shouldn’t have to pose an ultimatum to the American people between receiving a check from the government every month for $1,000, or maintaining their disability payments.

<p>UBI’s main drawing point is that it is a simplification of the welfare system, which might sound appealing at face value to conservatives, but Yang does not jump on this idea and instead adds more complications to an already overly complicated American tax and welfare system. His solution is to put more taxes along the production chain, which inevitably get passed on to the consumer, who he then gives $1,000 back to, thus creating an overcomplicated system that doesn’t do anything better or more efficiently than our current system.

<p>What Yang fails to understand is that although people will have more money to spend, their money will have less purchasing power as the cost of goods will increase with the cost of production. The biggest problem is not the UBI, but the tax that comes along with it. The fact of the matter is that there is no good way to currently pay for such a program that would not ultimately fall back on the consumer and create a cycle of inflation. The threat of automation taking jobs from low-skilled workers - of which Yang is afraid - does have merit, but in a free market economy such as the United States, the economics for a UBI simply do not work out.  <a href="https://www.thefenwickreview.com/archive/2020/2/6/the-internets-obsession-andrew-yangs-ubi">Link to site</a></p>

        <summary><em>The Uninhabitable Discussion: December 21, 2019</em></summary>
        <p>This academic year, the Holy Cross administration decided to have all incoming freshmen - a group whose opinions in the political climate in college are still up in the air - read an appallingly un-academic book that spews controversial science as dogma and goes out of its way to paint a depressing apocalyptic view of the world. It would be impossible to provide a comprehensive refutation of every supposed fact in this work, but instead I would like to explain why The Uninhabitable Earth by David Wallace-Wells is an appallingly unscientific book where facts are replaced by obscure controversial research that he spouts out in the hope of scaring the ill-informed into action. Additionally, I would like to discuss the abhorrent way some of the Holy Cross faculty handled the discussion, in which they endorsed the views in the book wholeheartedly without leaving much room for discussion.

<p>The point of this book is to scare readers into action - that is its whole purpose. Wallace-Wells forges together a make-believe apocalyptic fantasy hellscape where he presents what he sees as a great existential crisis while he professes our impending doom, which is the focus of about half of the book. The longest of the four sections, “Elements of Chaos,” gives a non-stop barrage of separate doomsday scenarios fueled by conflicting statistics that suit that particular scenario to create the most terrifying situation one could imagine. He talks about every natural disaster he could think of whether that is floods, wildfire, intense heat, etc.

<p>Additionally, Wallace-Wells will also take shots at anything or anyone right of Bernie Sanders. At one point, in his section on drowning and floods - in an attempt to inflate perceived magnitude - he uses the Black Sea deluge hypothesis as a reference point, and just so carefully includes a quick sentence about how Noah’s Ark was not an event but rather a fictional story prompted by the deluge itself. He also repeatedly brings up the supposed present-day oppression of people of color without much reason. As a book about climate change, it's hard to see how these other leftist ideas are necessary without some further political agenda beyond just climate change.

<p>Wallace-Wells also occasionally sneaks in certain paragraphs, in an attempt to seem scientific, admitting that climate science is completely unreliable in most cases, which is a nice gesture but completely undermines his primary agenda. In his “Drowning” section, he discusses how it would be foolish to “take any of [these predictions] to the bank.” Wallace-Wells wouldn't bet on any of his own predictions, the same predictions on which his whole book is predicated, even though he presents them as facts to fit into his climate change hellscape narrative. This appears to be a theme of his, in an attempt to try and seem more legitimate as he, earlier in the “Heat Death” section of the novel, called projecting future warming a fool’s game. It would seem that what Wallace-Wells calls foolish is the same thing off of which he bases his entire fantasy world. Additionally, his flip-flopping from statistic to statistic based on different projected degrees of warming from different sources that seem convenient in the moment exposes not only his non-commitment to delivering an accurate prediction of what might happen, but also his commitment to skewing the data in a questionable manner to fit his political agenda.

<p>The problem is not so much that the book is a terrible attempt at disinformation, as that can be easily addressed and rebutted, but that the Holy Cross faculty in charge of the discussion did not bother to address any counterargument, but rather opted to present a partisan charade where manmade change climate change, and the apocalyptic result from it, are presented as fact. The faculty instead decided to focus on what we as students can do to prevent climate change.

<p>Many Holy Cross professors skipped the climate change debate and went straight to the partisan question that they, as partisans, seem to be most focused on. They are interested in how to solve manmade climate change, regardless of whether or not it is real or poses a significant threat to the human race. Though I am in the Divine Cluster in the Montserrat program, I spoke to students in other clusters who shared the same experience. Students in other clusters believe that opinions of the faculty were thrust upon us as mandated truth. At a required Montserrat event, faculty in charge took science as fact, and even invited the leadership of Eco-Action to speak to us for an extended amount of time, giving them an unopposed platform to impose their political opinions on the freshman class. The job of any college faculty is to present the grounds for intellectual discussion on any assigned reading, but instead all we got was a lecture on what to do with the suspected inevitable terror of an apocalyptic world fueled by the Wallace-Wells book.

<p>To be clear, I have no problem with Eco-Action and I am not looking to pick a fight. I may disagree with what they do, but I have no problem with them operating as a student organization. What I do have a problem with is the faculty forcing us to listen to a partisan organization with no contradictory opinion being given the same platform. And to those who would say that Eco-Action isn't partisan, I would like to refer them to their mission statement, which is easily accessible on the Holy Cross website, which makes a clear mention that they work alongside political campaigns for what they refer to as “environmental” progress and supportive of “social justice.” The Holy Cross faculty in a required event, in a required class, gave a platform to a partisan group and endorsed their opinions whole-heartedly. That is my problem.

<p>I am not going to make the same mistake as Wallace-Wells and not give solutions to this problem, which he neglects to do in his book. There is no way to change or fix the past in this situation. After the writing of this article, I will move on and most likely never think of this book or the actions that the faculty took ever again. But to prevent this situation in the future, I would suggest that the subject of climate change ought to be addressed in a way that allows the correct set of ideas to flourish (whether that be on either end of the debate), rather than a monopoly on the platform to speak by those convinced the Earth is in a state of impending turmoil as we supposedly destroy ourselves.

<p>On a final note, just last October, 500 climate scientists wrote a letter to the UN saying that there is no climate emergency and that climate change has not caused any increase in natural disasters, but Wallace-Wells or the Holy Cross faculty would not tell you that. Instead, they would force a malleable group of people to read an unacademic book trying to scare them into having an existential crisis about climate change. The book may very well have been a disguised effort to impose a political opinion on the masses. There was no attempt to hold a discussion around the topic, and in the end it made the situation uninhabitable for those who seek to question what others say and think for themselves.  <a href="https://www.thefenwickreview.com/archive/2019/12/21/uninhabitable-discussion">Link to site</a></p>
